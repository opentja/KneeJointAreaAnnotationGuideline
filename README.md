# Knee Joint Area Annotation Guideline

<p align="justify">
We developed this annotation guideline to reliably and precisely annotate the knee joint area in plain radiographs. The current annotation guideline helps to construct fully-annotated knee X-ray datasets to train, validate, and test data hungry <strong> deep learning computer vision </strong> methods to automatically and objectively detect and localize knee joint area in X-rays. 
For the purpose of being reliable, we used anatomical landmarks of the knee joint which allows even annotators without any experience in medical field to annotate with high degree of reliability and precision.

 We have prepared separate annotation guideline for knees with and without a prosthesis as well as anteroposterior (AP) and Lateral knee views. In our annotation guideline for a knee without a prosthesis we have used patella bone, medial femoral condyle, lateral border of the fibular head as well as junction of the tibia and fibula bones. For a knee with a regular and long-stem prosthesis, we have used patella bone, medial femoral condyle, lateral border of the fibular head as well as the upper and lower border of the femoral and tibia components of the prosthesis.
